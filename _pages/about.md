Welcome to my homepage! \
I'm Tuan Anh. I recently graduated from the University of Information Technology, VNU-HCM, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. During my undergraduate studies, I joined the [Evolutionary Learning and Optimization](https://sites.google.com/view/evolve-learn-optimize) (ELO) Lab as a research student, conducting research under the supervision of Dr. [Ngoc Hoang Luong](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=p3vHDZYAAAAJ&hl=en).
